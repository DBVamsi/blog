# About me

I am Technical Writer by passion and profession, and I love technology. I convert technical jargon into easy-to-understand, everyday language!

I started this blog/website hoping to write articles that I think are worth sharing with the world. Here you can find articles ranging from cooking recipes to how the software works.

Thanks for visiting!
